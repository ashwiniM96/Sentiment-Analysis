# Sentiment-Analysis
Text analysis operations we are performing using NLTK package. We start with the first process that is Word tokenization.A Sentiment classifier is learned from the labels that we pass to train our model, usually they are the positive reviews and the negative reviews. The classification in our case is being done using Multinomial Naive Bayes model classifier and Logistic Regression model. For analysing the performance of the model, we tend to divide the dataset into train set and test set. The dataset is being split using the train_test_split() function, where three parameters are been passed features, target and the test_set size ,along with this we also use random_state so that we can select the records randomly.TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, which I tried to implement for feature generation, where term frequency is just used to count the number of words occurred in the data and Inverse Document Frequency measures the amount of information a given word provides across the document ,moreover it is logarithmically scaled inverse ratio of the number of documents which contain that word and the total number of documents.Similarly, like for multinomial Na√Øve Bayes, we import the module for Logistic regressionand the use the Logistic regression classifier object. Thereafter, by using the fit () function the model was been fitted on the train set and prediction was performed on the test set where an accuracy of 64.32% was obtained.
